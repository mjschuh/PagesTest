### Introduction
The MiniWall software is browser-based software that is used
to analyze and understand large and small computationally and
experimentally generated data sets.  The MiniWall software presents
a matrix view of plots and other visualization images and provides
a responsive and productive way to investigate the data and extract
knowledge and understanding from it.  Since it is browser based,
it runs on any computer or device that can display a web page.
It can also be used remotely and securely by using web server
software such as the Apache HTTP Server.

### Getting Started
Clone the MiniWall repository and then open the index.html file with a Google Chrome browser.  Read the AIAA MiniWall paper
to learn more about the MiniWall software, learn how to use it, and how it works.  Customize the MiniWall software to work
with you data set by modifying the MiniWall_vent_paper.html main page, setup_MiniWall_vent_paper.js configuration file,
and the get_image_root_name_from_cell_column_and_row_names() function in the utils_object.js file for your data set.
